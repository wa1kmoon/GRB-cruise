(Urumqi No.1 Senior High School), J.Z. Liu (XAO) report:

We observed the field of Swift GRB 211221A (Page et al. GCN Circ. 
31273) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, 
China. We obtained 10x90 s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 
21:26:30 UT on 2021-12-21, i.e., 0.63 hr after the BAT trigger.

No optical source is detected at the Swift/XRT position in our stacked
image, down to a limiting magnitude of r~20.2, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
