Due to a typo, the OT datetime data in the table(GCN 28760) was wrong
Here are the correct values

  T-Tmid      Date      Time       Expt.        Ra                Dec         Mag

The OT position is coincident with UVOT and XRT position. The afterglow appears to be fading rapidly.

The 0.6m BOOTES-2/TELMA robotic telescope at IHSM La Mayora (UMA-CSIC) in Algarrobo Costa (Malaga, Spain) automatically responded to the Swift trigger of GRB 201024A (Marshall et al. GCNC 28761). A series of images were taken starting on Oct 24 at Oct 02:50:07 UT (~68 s after trigger). A bright optical source is detected on the first image (10s, clear filter) with r= 14.1 mag, at a position consistent with the optical afterglow reported by UVOT/Swift (Marshall et al. GCNC 28761) and MASTER (Lipunov et al. GCNC 28760).

Furthermore, from a deeper image gathered at the 1.5m OSN telescope in Observatorio de Sierra Nevada at 03:16 UT we measure R = 18.9, thus confirming the rapid fading of the optical afterglow brightness as pointed out on GCNC 28762.

Additional observations are ongoing.  We thank the staff at La Mayora and OSN for their excellent support.

We observed the afterglow (Lipunov et al., GCN#28760, Marshall et al., 
GCN#28761, Fernandez-Garcia et al., GCN#28763) of GRB 201024A (Marshall 
et al., GCN#28761) with the 10.4m GTC telescope, at Roque de los 
Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain) equipped with OSIRIS. The 
observation started on 24 October 2020 at 03:28:47 UT (0.663 hrs after 
the GRB onset) and consisted of 3 x 900 s with the R1000B grism, 
covering the wavelength range between 3700 and 7800 AA. Observations 
were taken under good conditions but high airmass.

At the afterglow position, a clear source is detected. We measure r' ~ 
19.3 mag (AB) vs. nearby PanSTARRS field stars. This indicates the 
source has faded rapidly vs. the early MASTER/BOOTES detection, as 
Lipunov et al., GCN#28760 and Fernandez-Garcia et al., GCN#28763 stated.

A preliminary reduction of the spectrum shows a clear continuum, with 
MnII, FeII, FeII*, MgII, and MgI absorption lines, as well as the [OII] 
doublet in emission, all at a common redshift of z = 0.999, which we 
identify as the redshift of the GRB.

We furthermore note that there is an underlying galaxy at the OT 
position visible in SDSS and PanSTARRS, at r ~ 21.15 mag. We also see a 
second galaxy offset by a few arcsec in our finding chart.

We thank P. D'Avanzo and L. Izzo for pointing out the galaxy.
