P.A. Evans (U. Leicester), J.P. Osborne (U. Leicester) and D.N. Burrows
(PSU) report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

The XRT began observing the field of GRB 201015A at 23:43:47.2 UT,
3214.1 seconds after the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we
find a fading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 354.32067,
53.41460 which is equivalent to:
   RA(J2000)  = 23h 37m 16.96s (23:37:16.96  354.32067)
   Dec(J2000) = +53d 24' 52.6" (+53:24:52.6" 53.41460)
with an uncertainty of 3.8 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 91 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. 

A power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event
data gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 3.60
x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013).

DATE:    20/10/16 06:48:24 GMT
FROM:    Phil Evans at U of Leicester  <pae9@leicester.ac.uk>

P.A. Evans, M.R. Goad, J.P. Osborne and A.P. Beardmore (U. Leicester) 
report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team.

Using 1576 s of XRT Photon Counting mode data and 4 UVOT
images for GRB 201015A, we find an astrometrically corrected X-ray
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 354.31859, +53.41603 which is equivalent
to:

RA (J2000): 23h 37m 16.46s
Dec (J2000): +53d 24' 57.7"

with an uncertainty of 1.7 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

This position may be improved as more data are received. The latest
position can be viewed at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_positions. Position
enhancement is described by Goad et al. (2007, A&A, 476, 1401) and Evans
et al. (2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177).

SUBJECT: GRB 201015A: NOT optical afterglow confirmation
DATE:    20/10/16 01:21:02 GMT
FROM:    Daniele B Malesani at DTU Space  <malesani@space.dtu.dk>

D. B. Malesani (DTU Space), A. de Ugarte Postigo (HETH, IAA/CSIC), T. 
Pursimo (NOT), report on behalf of a larger collaboration:

We observed the field of GRB 201015A (D'Elia et al., GCN 28632) using 
the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC camera. Our 
first image was taken at 23:25:12 UT (35 min after the trigger). At the 
location of the afterglow candidate reported by Lipunov et al. (GCN 
28633), also consistent with the XRT position (Kennea et al., GCN 
28635), we detect a source not visible in the Pan-STARRS images of the 
same area. We report for this target the following, refined coordinates:

RA(J2000) = 23:37:16.41
Dec(J2000) = +53:24:56.5

with an uncertainty of 0.3" (calibrated against the Gaia catalog).

Our image was taken with a non-standard, broad filter (~3700-9000 AA), 
and the target is affected by a saturation defect from a star. We cannot 
provide a reliable magnitude at the present time, but a rough estimate 
yields ~19.
