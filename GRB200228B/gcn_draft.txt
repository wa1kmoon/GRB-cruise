X. Liu, D. Xu, Z.P. Zhu, B.Y. Yu, Y. Ma (NAOC), X. Gao (Urumqi No.1 
Senior High School) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200228B (Laha et al., GCN 27254) using the 
NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations 
started at 21:11:28 UT on 2020-02-28 (i.e., 9.97h after the BAT 
trigger), and 10*120 s Sloan r-band frames were obtained. 

No optical afterglow was detected in the Swift XRT's error circle (Evans et al., GCN 27256) from 
initial frames, down to a limiting magnitude of m(r) ~ 20.8, calibrated 
with the nearby panstarrs field.
