X. Liu, D. Xu, Z.P. Zhu, B.Y. Yu, H.J. Wang, L. Ge (NAOC) report:

We observed the field of GRB 200125A (Lien et al., GCN 26876) using the 
3.8-m United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) through the K-band. 
Observations started at 14:54:24 UT on 2020-01-27 (i.e., 2.14 d after the BAT 
trigger), and 2965 s(i.e., 49.42 min) K-band imagining was obtained in a seeing of ~1.0".

No NIR afterglow is detected within the enhanced Swift-XRT error 
circle (Beardmore et al., GCN Circ. 26878), down to 
a limiting magnitude of K ~ 18.34, calibrated with the nearby 2 MASS stars.

We thank the great support of the UKIRT staff/observer, in particular 
Michael Pohlen and Watson Varricatt.
