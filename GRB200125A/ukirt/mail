Dear UKIRT staff,

We just submitted the request of H-band photometry of GRB200215A, which exploded ~12 hours ago (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27079.gcn3). Its optical afterglow was not detected to a quite deep limit since the very beginning, which implies that it's either a dark GRB or a high-redshift GRB. We wish the pending H-band observations tonight would help to diagnose the nature of the GRB.

We put the target in the field of the 2nd Camera. If the request cannot be executed tonight, please abort it.

Thanks a lot!
