## GCN 27936 GRB 200613A: Swift-XRT afterglow detection

Seven uncatalogued X-ray sources are detected, of which one ("Source
2") is above the RASS limit, and is therefore likely the GRB afterglow.
Using 4079 s of PC mode data and 4 UVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT
position (using the XRT-UVOT alignment and matching UVOT field sources
to the USNO-B1 catalogue): RA, Dec = 153.04199, +45.75408 which is
equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 10h 12m 10.08s
Dec(J2000): +45d 45' 14.7"

with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This
position is 5.8 arcmin from the Fermi/LAT position. 


## GCN 27935 GRB 200613A: Candidate afterglow from OAJ

We observed the LAT position of the bright GRB 200613A (Fermi-LAT 
detection: Ohno et al. GCN #27931, Fermi GBM detection: Bissaldi & 
Lesage, GCN #27930) with the T80 0.8m telescope at the Observatorio de 
Javalambre (Teruel, Spain). Observations consisted of 3 x 300 s in g', 3 
x 300 s in r', and 5 x 180 s in i'.

At the position of the second reported XRT source, we detect an optical 
source not seen to several magnitudes deeper in PanSTARRS archival 
imaging. The source is detected in each frame. The position is RA 
(J2000) = 10:12:10.08, Dec. (J2000) = 45:45:14.26 with an estimated 
error of 0".5. There is also a cataloged SDSS source nearby at RA 
(J2000) = 10:12:10.075, Dec. (J2000) = 45:45:12.88, this may be the host 
galaxy of the GRB, though we note nothing is detected here in the 
PanSTARRS image.
