The afterglow would be slightly fainter than 22.0 mag if this powerlaw decay is extrapolated until the NOT observational time, being consistent with the observed NOT upper limit. So the afterglow could be decaying in a single powerlaw until the NOT observation or have broken to a steeper decay before the NOT observation.

27837|GRB 200528A: Nanshan/NEXT optical upper limit|GRB 200528A|https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27837.gcn3|We observed the field of GRB 2005528A (Ambrosi et al., GCN 27832) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 5x120s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 15:55:41 UT on 2020-05-28, i.e., 5.47 hr after the burst.No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 27836), down to a limiting magnitude of r~20.1, calibrated with nearby SDSS field.
27161|GRB 200219C: Nanshan/NEXT optical upper limit and possible host galaxy from PanSTARRS|GRB 200219C|https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27161.gcn3|We observed the field of the possible X-ray afterglow by Swift/XRT (Burrows et al., GCN 27157) of GRB 200219C detected by Fermi/GBM and Fermi/LAT (GCN 27145; Dirirsa et al., GCN 27151), using the 0.6m NEXT telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations started at 22:45:55 UT on 2020-02-20 (i.e., 22.8 h after the Fermi trigger) and 10x300 s Sloan r-band frames were obtained.No optical counterpart is detected in our stacked image at the Swift XRT position, down to a limiting magnitude of r~21.0.Inspection of PanSTARRS reveals a faint, extended source within the XRT error circle. It's localized at coordinates: R.A. (J2000) = 17:30:02.21, Dec.(J2000) = +10:32:22.69, and has r = 22.70 +/- 0.15 mag. Thus is may be the host galaxy of the GRB, if the Swift XRT detection is the afterglow of the GRB.
27104|GRB 200216B: Nanshan/NEXT early optical upper limit and possible host galaxy|GRB 200216B|https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27104.gcn3|We observed the field of GRB 200216B (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 27102) using the NEXT 0.6m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations automatically started at 13:33:46 UT on 2002-02-16, i.e., 73 s after the BAT trigger. We obtained 3x40 s, 4x60 s, 3x90 s and onging 200 s frames in the Sloan r-filter. The altitude for the GRB and the weather has been improving.No optical afterglow is detected in our images at the XRT position (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 27102) down to a limiting magnitude of r~20.0.Meanwhile, we note that there exists a very marginally detected blob (thus noise fluctuation not ruled out yet), extended and being positionally consistent with the XRT position both in PanSTAR r-band field, centred at coordinates: R.A. (J2000) = 10:41:44.23, Dec. (J2000) = +19:28:33.18. The source would be of r~23 in depth, and might be the host galaxy of the GRB. Deep imaging would identify the nature of the blob.

Observations automatically started at 14:40:59 UT on 2002-02-15, i.e., 88 s after the BAT trigger. We obtained 3x40 s,  4x60 s, and 5x90 s frames in the Sloan r-filter. Observations then ended due to follow-ups of LIGO/Virgo S200213t.No optical afterglow is detected in our images at the XRT position (Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) down to a limiting magnitude of r~18.0, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
