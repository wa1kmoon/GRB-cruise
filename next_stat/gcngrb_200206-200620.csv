27837,GRB 200528A: Nanshan/NEXT optical upper limit,GRB 200528A,https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27837.gcn3,We observed the field of GRB 2005528A (Ambrosi et al., GCN 27832) using the NEXT-0.6m telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. We obtained 5x120s frames in the Sloan r-band, starting at 15:55:41 UT on 2020-05-28, i.e., 5.47 hr after the burst.No optical source is detected in our stacked image at the enhanced XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 27836), down to a limiting magnitude of r~20.1, calibrated with nearby SDSS field.
27161,GRB 200219C: Nanshan/NEXT optical upper limit and possible host galaxy from PanSTARRS,GRB 200219C,https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27161.gcn3,We observed the field of the possible X-ray afterglow by Swift/XRT (Burrows et al., GCN 27157) of GRB 200219C detected by Fermi/GBM and Fermi/LAT (GCN 27145; Dirirsa et al., GCN 27151), using the 0.6m NEXT telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations started at 22:45:55 UT on 2020-02-20 (i.e., 22.8 h after the Fermi trigger) and 10x300 s Sloan r-band frames were obtained.No optical counterpart is detected in our stacked image at the Swift XRT position, down to a limiting magnitude of r~21.0.Inspection of PanSTARRS reveals a faint, extended source within the XRT error circle. It's localized at coordinates: R.A. (J2000) = 17:30:02.21, Dec.(J2000) = +10:32:22.69, and has r = 22.70 +/- 0.15 mag. Thus is may be the host galaxy of the GRB, if the Swift XRT detection is the afterglow of the GRB.
27104,GRB 200216B: Nanshan/NEXT early optical upper limit and possible host galaxy,GRB 200216B,https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27104.gcn3,We observed the field of GRB 200216B (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 27102) using the NEXT 0.6m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations automatically started at 13:33:46 UT on 2002-02-16, i.e., 73 s after the BAT trigger. We obtained 3x40 s, 4x60 s, 3x90 s and onging 200 s frames in the Sloan r-filter. The altitude for the GRB and the weather has been improving.No optical afterglow is detected in our images at the XRT position (D'Avanzo et al., GCN 27102) down to a limiting magnitude of r~20.0.Meanwhile, we note that there exists a very marginally detected blob (thus noise fluctuation not ruled out yet), extended and being positionally consistent with the XRT position both in PanSTAR r-band field, centred at coordinates: R.A. (J2000) = 10:41:44.23, Dec. (J2000) = +19:28:33.18. The source would be of r~23 in depth, and might be the host galaxy of the GRB. Deep imaging would identify the nature of the blob.
27081,GRB 200215A: Nanshan/NEXT optical upper limit,GRB 200215A,https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/27081.gcn3,We observed the field of GRB 200215A (Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) using the NEXT 0.6m optical telescope located at Nanshan, Xinjiang, China. Observations automatically started at 14:40:59 UT on 2002-02-15, i.e., 88 s after the BAT trigger. We obtained 3x40 s,  4x60 s, and 5x90 s frames in the Sloan r-filter. Observations then ended due to follow-ups of LIGO/Virgo S200213t.No optical afterglow is detected in our images at the XRT position (Bernardini et al., GCN 27079) down to a limiting magnitude of r~18.0, calibrated with the nearby PanSTARRS field.
